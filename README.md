**Back-End**

The back-end layer is powered by Express.js, a framework built on top of Node.js, which manages servers, routes, and handles HTTP requests asynchronously.

Features

Server Setup
Express.js server setup with CORS support: The backend of the School Management System is built on the Express.js framework. Express.js provides a robust and flexible foundation for handling HTTP requests and managing routes. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support is implemented to allow secure communication with the frontend, even when they are hosted on different domains.

MongoDB connection for efficient data storage and management: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is utilized for data storage and management. MongoDB's efficiency and flexibility make it a suitable choice for handling various types of data within the application. It ensures that data can be stored, retrieved, and managed effectively.

Implementation of environmental variables using dotenv for configuration: Environmental variables are used to store sensitive information and configuration settings securely. The dotenv library is employed to load these variables, ensuring that sensitive data such as database credentials and API keys are kept confidential.

API Routes and Controllers

Creation of API routes for student and staff account management: API routes are established to define endpoints for managing student and staff accounts. These routes allow users to interact with the system, including user registration, login, and profile management.

Implementation of controllers to handle business logic for API endpoints: Controllers contain the business logic necessary to process incoming requests and provide responses. They manage tasks such as user authentication, data validation, and interactions with the database.

User registration and authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWT is employed to secure user authentication and authorization. Upon successful login, a unique token is generated and sent to the client, which is used for subsequent authenticated requests.

Handling of user profile management, including updates and password resets: Users can update their profiles, including personal information and preferences. Additionally, the system supports password reset functionality for user convenience.

Real-time chat functionality using Socket.io, allowing users to communicate within class group chats: Socket.io is integrated to facilitate real-time chat features. Users can join chat rooms, send and receive messages, and engage in class group discussions.

Integration with cloud services (Cloudinary) for file storage and retrieval: Cloudinary is used to manage file storage and retrieval, enabling users to upload and access various types of media, such as images, videos and documents.

Password Hashing: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database. This hashing process adds an extra layer of security by transforming plain-text passwords into irreversible, cryptographically hashed values.

Password Validation and Comparison: When users log in, their entered passwords are validated and compared securely with the hashed passwords stored in the database using bcrypt. This ensures that only authorized users with valid credentials can access the system.

Socket.io Integration

Implementation of Socket.io for real-time chat features: Socket.io is utilized to enable real-time chat functionality within the application. It provides a seamless communication platform for users to interact instantly.

Joining chat rooms and sending/receiving messages: Users can join specific chat rooms, initiate conversations, and receive messages from other users in real-time.

Broadcast messages to specific chat rooms: Messages can be broadcasted to specific chat rooms, allowing targeted communication and group discussions among users.

Payment Gateway Integration

Integration of Paystack for processing acceptance and application fee payments: Paystack, a payment gateway, is integrated to facilitate secure and convenient payment processing. Students can make payments for acceptance or application fees using this payment gateway.

Handling payment evidence uploads and verification: The system supports the upload of payment evidence to validate payments. This ensures that students can provide proof of payment, enhancing transparency and record-keeping.

Email and SMS Integration

Integration with nodemailer for sending email notifications: Nodemailer is used to send email notifications to users. It enables the system to deliver important updates, notifications, and communication via email.

Integration with Twilio for SMS notifications: Twilio is integrated to send SMS notifications to users. This feature provides an additional communication channel for important alerts and notifications.

Server Deployment

Deployment of the Express.js server to a specific port: The Express.js server is deployed to a specific port, allowing it to listen for incoming requests and respond accordingly.

CORS configuration to allow specific origins for socket connections: CORS configuration is implemented to specify which origins (domains) are allowed to establish socket connections with the server. This security measure helps prevent unauthorized access.

Implementation of error handling for server and database connections: Comprehensive error handling is in place to gracefully manage server and database errors. This ensures that the application can recover from unexpected issues and provide informative error messages when necessary.

These backend features collectively form the backbone of the School Management System, enabling secure authentication, efficient data management, real-time communication, payment processing, and seamless user interactions.
