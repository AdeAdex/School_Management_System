# School_Management_System
I am developing a School Management System, which will be my first full-stack web application. The application is intended to be cross-platform and compatible with any standards-compliant browser, including desktop and mobile devices. It will leverage progressive enhancement, service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features to provide users with a native app-like experience."

The front-end of the application will be built using Vite + React, a modern build tool and a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Express.js, a framework built on top of Node.js, will be used as the back-end layer to manage servers, routes, and handle HTTP requests asynchronously.

For data storage, I will be using MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to efficiently store and manage the application's data.

Once completed, the school management system web application will have the following functionalities:

User Authentication: Users will be able to sign up and log in securely to access personalized features and data.

Dashboard: After logging in, users will have access to their personalized dashboard, where they can view important information and perform various actions.

Course Registration: Students will be able to register for their courses online, making the process more convenient and efficient.

Profile Management: Users will have the ability to update and manage their profile information, such as contact details and preferences.

Resource Access: Students will be able to access learning resources, study materials, and other educational content relevant to their courses.

Password Reset: Users will have the option to reset their passwords in case they forget them.

Responsive Design: The application will be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Offline Support: The use of service workers will enable the application to work offline or with limited connectivity, allowing users to access certain features even without an internet connection.

Push Notifications: Users may receive notifications and alerts related to their courses, updates, and important announcements.

Database Management: The application will efficiently manage and organize data using MongoDB, ensuring data integrity and security.

Overall, the school management system web application will offer a user-friendly, seamless, and efficient experience for students, teachers, and administrators, facilitating various tasks and enhancing the learning process within the school community.
