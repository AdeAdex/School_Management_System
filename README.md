# School_Portal
I am developing this school web application and once am done, it will be my first MERN stack web application .  
I will be using Vite + React as the front-end and will also be using Express.js as a layer built on the top of the Node.js that will helps manage servers and routes and will handle HTTP requests asynchronously. So also I will be using mongo DB as the Database.
This school portal web application will be able to perform the following when am done.
1. Register an Account and received Registration Number and Matric Number.  
2. Login successfully to your School Portal.  
3. Create a database for the school.  
4. Access your school portal and make some available changes on your portal.  
5. Register Course and receive results on your portal. etc.
