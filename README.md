# School_Portal
I am developing this school progressive web application (PWAs) and once am done, it will be my first MERN stack web application . It is intended to work on any platform with a standards-compliant browser, including desktop and mobile devices. The progressive web application will use service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features in combination with progressive enhancement to give users an experience on par with native apps.
I will be using Vite + React as the front-end and will also be using Express.js as a layer built on the top of the Node.js that will helps manage servers and routes and will handle HTTP requests asynchronously. So also I will be using mongoDB as the Database.
This school portal web application will be able to perform the following when am done.
1. Installable, responsively designed, linkable discoverable, re-engageable.
1. Register an Account and received Registration Number and Matric Number.  
2. Login successfully to your School Portal.  
3. Create a database for the school.  
4. Access your school portal and make some available changes on your portal.  
5. Register Course and receive results on your portal. etc.
